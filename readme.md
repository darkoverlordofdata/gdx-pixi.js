# gdx-pixi.js

An alternate js backend for libGDX

A libGDX api in scala.js 
Lets libGDX game written for Android/Desktop work in the browser

Status - just started. It displays the libGDX hello world.

Why? Doesn't libGDX already have the gwt wrapper?
Yes, but it's not compatible with some other options that I need.
And I think that pixijs is better in the browser
Besides, this is fun.
